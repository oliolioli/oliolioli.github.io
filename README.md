# 3D model of Bern, Switzerland

The altitude profile was sourced from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and integrated into a [Blender](https://www.blender.org) model. 
Additionally, building height data was included, allowing the 3D structures to be accurately placed on the terrain.

To enhance realism, [satellite images from NASA](https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov) were mapped onto the 3D model and carefully scaled to align as accurately as possible.

The entire 3D model was exported from Blender in a format compatible with [Three.js](https://threejs.org), ensuring smooth rendering in a web environment.
