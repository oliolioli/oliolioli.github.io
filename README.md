***This 3D model depicts Bern, Switzerland***

The altitude profile was sourced from OpenStreetMap and integrated into a Blender model. Additionally, building height data was included, allowing the 3D structures to be accurately placed on the terrain.

To enhance realism, free satellite images from NASA were mapped onto the 3D model and carefully scaled to align as accurately as possible.
